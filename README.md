# Lightroom to Photos Plugin

A Lightroom Export Plugin to add support for direct export to Apple Photos with HEIC conversion for iCloud storage optimisation.

### Features

* Export Lightroom photos directly to Apple Photos
* Export corresponding unprocessed camera JPEGs (if preferred). Personally I prefer Canon's JPEG colour over Lightroom's camera matching profile, so prefer this as an option to making global edits for documentary/non-artistic shots.


### Existing Plugins / Research

* https://github.com/sto3014/LRPhotos: LRPhotos is a Lightroom Classic publishing service for Apple's Photos app.
* https://github.com/cimm/iphotoexportservice/: The Lightroom to iPhoto plugin exports the selected photos from Adobe Lightroom to iPhoto and creates an album with these photos if needed.
